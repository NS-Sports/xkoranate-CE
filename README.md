# xkoranate-CE
This README is a work in progress and should not be considered final.
## Overview

xkoranate-CE (xkoranate, **C**ommunity **E**dition) is a fork of ThirdGeek/Commerce Heights' **xkoranate** program, used for generating scores for sporting events held in NS Sports, the sports roleplay forum for the nation simulation game, NationStates.

**From Commerce Heights' (original creator) Web page on xkoranate:**

"xkoranate is a program that can be used to simulate results of a wide variety of individual and team sports, including Olympic sports. It is capable of scorinating events in one hundred disciplines of over sixty sports."

## Compiling/Installation
### Linux

**You will need:**
* A C++ compiler, such as `gcc`.

### Windows
Coming soon!

### macOS
Coming soon!

## Sport files

Each available event has parameters which are stored in an editable xml file. These files are placed in the “sports” directory, which can be found in xkoranate.app/Contents/Resources/sports/ in the Mac os version. In version 0.3.1 and later (including xkoranate-CE), the application should automatically find this directory.

## Contribution guidelines
When making a change, please follow these steps to maintain code integrity:
* Create a new branch from master to your own fork. DO NOT create new branches on the main repo. 
* Compile and test your changes on your fork where possible.
* If successful, merge to the test (or dev) branch, with a comment explaining your results, and request a review by another member of the organisation (anyone will do!)
* Once verified by a second developer, they can merge changes to the master branch.

Code changes should never be commmitted directly to the master branch without testing and review.

Full guidelines are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h_5nLUJ90Qs3oYZVGRUY9hYA3lsy1btA3Lb0AW_digc/edit), providing more detail for those who are less experienced with Git.
